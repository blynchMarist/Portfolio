Fall Semester-2020
This assignment was one that I particularly enjoyed for my Algorithm Analysis and Design class. In particular, 
I found my iteration of Quick Sort to be both interesting, and a bit of a challenge. Using the Introduction 
to Algorithms (aka CLRS) textbook as a reference, I decided to make my own iteration. I found that having three 
method arguments (ArrayList, bottomIndex, topIndex) was both redundant and a bit hard to follow. My iteration 
only required one argument (ArrayList) and utilized the concept of subarrays from Merge Sort.
