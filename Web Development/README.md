Fall 2019

This was a super fun, challenging, and interesting project that I completed for my Software Development II class. I learned a lot of new things in a very short
period of time. I was exposed to languages such as Javascript, HTML, CSS. I got exposure to REST API, Node, Express, and many different aspects of front/back end developing. 

PLEASE NOTE: Node.js installation required to run application. Application on port 3000.
